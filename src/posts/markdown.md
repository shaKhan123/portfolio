In this first post as a trial, I'm going to tell you how you can create markdown.
Yeah, really important stuff if you care! 
But you wont lose your job if you don't.
Markdown is just like ordinary text but you add some characters to give it an html like effect. 
I use it for  writing my posts.
So you start with an ordinary text and to make it ->
###Italic 
To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

###Bold
 To make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

 ###Headers
 To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header.

 ###Link
 There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

I hope you enjoyed this post or not.. Either way, I already said it  was meant for trial and not to make you understand anything but you can always visit google if that left you  curious ;)
