    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I started my programming career as a computer science student, spending time with some css, Italian, Arabic,
       hours of wasting time on facebook and leaving random comments on social media,  then php, then java then back to css and finally
      choosing java as my profession. Currently employed at IntelliaTech which introduced me to brave new world. My bestie and cats rock my world, something I'm grateful for!</p>
      <p> Long story short,  I started this website as a way to divert my attention from the epidemic and staying productive!
